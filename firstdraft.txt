** SCENARIO (Design Part 1) **
Simple design where the player is a rat. Move from room to room while avoiding
.random mouse traps, some paths trigger another .random seen event that counts
towards player HP. Rat has to acquire a food object and leave the home. Food
object = score. Eat food to replenish health. Escape with a big food object to
win. Game play loop = put player into position to have to risk being caught to 
esacpe with a good food item. Keep good food in kitchen, dining room with no
escapes and make them gamble to get out with it or eat it and go back again.
